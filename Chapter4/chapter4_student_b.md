# Chapter 3: Tracking work with Git - Setup

## Student B

You will be creating the repo for this part of the course.

### Create a Repo

To begin, create a new tab in Git Kraken, then click "on GitHub" under "Start a hosted repo".

In the menu, select your own user and then copy the name and description fields as shown below. Then select somewhere reasonable to save your project on your computer and click "Create repository and clone".

You should now have a tab in Git Kraken that looks similar to the following screenshot. This is your new repo with the automatic initial commit. GitKraken also added an empty README file for you. This view shows all the entries in the history of the repo. There isn't much here yet.

Now you need to share the repo with your partner so they can also have access to it. Get the Github url by clicking on "origin" as shown in the picture below, and then selecting "View origin on Github.com".

You'll now need to copy and share the URL to this page with your partner.
