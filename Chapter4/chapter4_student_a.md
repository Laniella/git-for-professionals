## Student A

Your partner needs to create the repo before you can clone it.

### Clone a Repo

You should have received a link to a Github project from your partner at Checkpoint 2. Go to this URL and click the "Clone or Download" button as shown in the screenshot below. Make sure you have the https link in the popup and copy that URL. We'll use that to clone the repo in Git Kraken.

To clone your partner's repo, click "Clone a Repo" in the left-side menu. In the menu that appears, select a reasonable spot on your computer to save this new project. Then paste the URL you copied from github into the second box. Your screen should look similar to the following (but with a different path and URL).

After cloning completes, click "Open now" in the popup at the top of the window. You should now have a tab in Git Kraken that looks similar to the following screenshot. This view shows all the entries in the history of the repo. There isn't much here yet.
