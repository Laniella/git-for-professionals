# End of Course Assessment

There will be two parts to the assessment: the first part will be a Git exercise with some questions about the outcome; and the second part will be an open ended question section that will not be specifically scored, but will provide feedback on what your answers would likely have looked like. This should allow you to think about Git and its uses.
